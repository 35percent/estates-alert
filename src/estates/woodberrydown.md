Circa 1,000 homes on Hackney's Woodberry Down estate near Finsbury Park remain under threat of demolition.

Circa 900 homes have already been demolished in the first two phases. Phase 3 of the scheme was granted planning permission in Summer 2019. The scheme proposes to build 5,872 new homes in total over eight phases of development.

The estate has been sold by Hackney Council in a phased conditional agreement to a joint venture between developer Berkeley Homes and Notting Hill Genesis housing association (cf. Aylesbury estate). 

In August 2019, it was [reported](https://www.hackneycitizen.co.uk/2019/08/20/handful-leaseholders-council-plans-woodberry-down-redevelopment/) that _"42 per cent of the homes for private sale in the scheme have gone to overseas buyers, with a predicted net loss by the Town Hall of just over 300 social rented homes."_ and that _"Notting Hill Genesis have been actively seeking to prevent leaseholders taking up shared equity properties in favour of shared ownerships which would yield rental income"_.

The scheme is being [funded](/approved/funding) by the Mayor and [exempted](/approved/ballotexemptions) from his requirement to ballot residents on the demolition of their homes.

The first 'kick-start' phase one of the scheme was [approved in 2008](https://www.london.gov.uk/what-we-do/planning/planning-applications-and-decisions/planning-application-search/woodberry-down-estate-kick-start-site-one-0).

The 2014 revised master plan including phase 2 (in detailed format) and phases 3 to 8 (in outline) increased the number of housing by 920 units by 2035, for a total of 5,584 total new units, of which:

- 59%, or 3,292 will be private homes
- 41% or 2,265 will be “affordable housing” (with 40% social rent and 60% intermediate housing)

The first phase, along with new retail, open green spaces, a community centre, a park with playground area and a connection with the reservoirs, was completed in 2014. It has delivered 1433 units of which 566 “affordable” (39%), of which 421 for social (housing association) rent, and 145 for shared ownership.

By the end of phase 2, a total of 2,317 new homes have been delivered. The affordable component represents 887 units —of these, 537 are for social (housing association) rent.
In 2020, Hackney Council’s Planning Committee has approved Phase 3, which is currently under construction.

Phase 3 will deliver 584 additional housing units, of which 341 will be market rate (58%) and 243 will be “affordable” (42%, with 117 social (housing association) rent units and 126 shared ownership and shared equity units).

In addition, the development partners are now embarking on another review of the master plan which will impact Phases 5-8. The new figures for units for social rent (SR), shared ownership (SO) and private sale (PS) built, permitted and proposed as of 14 February 2023, provided by Hackney Council (see Table 1.), are as follows:

- Total units permitted (with  phases 4-8 as of Masterplan 2014 assumptions): 2,881
- Total units proposed: 5,872
- Total social (housing association) rent units proposed: 1,264
- Total shared ownership units proposed: 1,110
- Total private sale units proposed: 3,408

(Figures obtained from Hackney Council, February 2023).
