Just plain bootstrap5, (dart-)sass and autoprefixer (as recommended by official bootstrap documentation).

## Usage

### Local development

- `npm install`
- `npm start`
- Have fun!


Work with files in `src/`-folder, don't edit `_site` folder (dynamically generated). 

### Build

- `npm run build`

- Thanks to https://www.d-hagemeier.com/de/sass-compile-11ty/ for describing how `beforeBuild` works and can be used for dart-sass compilation.
